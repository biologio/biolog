Real-Time Health Intelligence

Biolog.io is a free and open source personal health record (PHR), accessible anywhere.
It combines these features
* Personal Health Record - a log of your personal health information
* Expert System - checks your information against known rules, flags some issues it identifies
* Quantified Self - self tracking of metrics
* Quality Improvement - produce checklists, capture feedback, reduce medical errors

Biolog.io is in development.
It is built using [Meteor](http://meteor.com).
Meteor allows Biolog to be built from a single code base.
This significantly reduces the work of development and maintenance.

Biolog seeks to solve a host of problems with modern health care and with electronic health records (EHRs):

| Problem | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| It takes 20 years or more for a medical best practice to find its way in mainstream clinical practice | Best practices added to Biolog.io can be deployed immediately. |
| Physicians are too busy to run through hundreds of advisories in a brief encounter | Involve the patient!  Keep your information up to date in Biolog.io and the advisories are added automatically. |
| Decision support built into many EHRs are too verbose to be helpful, and doctors routinely ignore them. | We address this by (1) filtering by priority, (2) distilling advisories into actionable checklists, and (3) taking them out of the 10 minute clinical doctor visit. |
| EHRs use terms that are not designed for billing and not user-friendly | Biolog.io supports a mix of conventional terms plus more precise medical language. |
| Research shows "error" rates in clinical medicine are as much as 50%, because of human limitation of physicians to think of everything that is known | Biolog.io seeks to reduce that error rate, by broadening the list of possibilities and considerations beyond a personâ€™s working memor.y |
| EHRs hide key information in unusable lists and tiny boxes | Biolog.io uses modern design techniques and attractive visualizations like timelines to display information. |
| Patients cannot contribute | Biolog.io puts the patient at the center of the record.  The patient defines who they trust to be able to view and contribute. |
1 patient has many EHRs, each of which has a different, limited focus and audience. | Biolog.io has 1 record for a patient
| Health information captured in most systems is locked away, and will never see the light of research. | A requirement of using Biolog.io is that your anonymized health information will be used for reseach and discovery.  Our core mission is to expand medical knowledge. |
| EHRs fail to consider tracking data from sensors | Biolog.io integrates sensor data into your health record (pedometers, heart rate monitors, ...) |
